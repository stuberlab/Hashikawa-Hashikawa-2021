These are the codes used for analysis and figure generation in the preprint manuscript "Pubertal sex hormones control transcriptional trajectories in the medial preoptic area" (Hashikawa, Hashikawa et al. 2021) from the Stuber lab.

The joint analysis and DEG analysis are based on Seurat v3 package from Satija lab. Detail tutorial can also be found in their website https://satijalab.org/seurat.

Trajectory analysis is based on Monocle 3 package from Trapnell lab https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3.

Regulatory analysis is based on SCENIC package from Aerts lab https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC.

The analysis starts from the "Doublet Detection" code with the data deposited at GEO :GSE172177. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE172177. The data will be publicly available once the manuscript is published.

Deposited data is gene-count matrix data which was generated by processing the FASTQ files through cellranger pipeline for alignment.
